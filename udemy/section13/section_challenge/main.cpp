/*
Program to track movie watching.

The program must support the following:
class Movie - models a movie that includes
- movie name
- movie rating
- watched (number of times movie has been watched)

class Movies - models a collection of movie objects

Obviously, Movies needs to know about Movie since it is a collection of Movice
object. However, our main driver should only interact with the Movie class.
For example:
- create a Movies object
- ask the Movies object
