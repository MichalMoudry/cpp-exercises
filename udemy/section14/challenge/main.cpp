/*
Overload the following operators in the provided MyString class.
Two versions:
    - Overload the operators using member functions
    - Overload the same operators using non-member functions

Here is a list of the operators:
- unary minus (-) : returns the lowercase version of the objects string
- == : returns true if strings are equal
- !=
- < : returns true if the lhs string is lexically less than the rhs string
- >
- + : concatenantion
- += : concatenate the rhs string to the lhs string and store the result in lhs object
- * : repeat; results in a string that is copied n times
    s2 = "abc"
    s1 = s2 * 3
    s1 will result in "abcabcabc"
- *= : repeat the string on the lhs n times and store the result back in the lhs object
    s1 = "abc"
    s1 *= 3
    s1 will result in "abcabcabc"
