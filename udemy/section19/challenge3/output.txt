82. 	PROLOGUE10
83. 1
84. 1
85. 	Two households, both alike in dignity,40
86. 	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,41
87. 	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,42
88. 	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.46
89. 	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes46
90. 	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;48
91. 	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows40
92. 	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.49
93. 	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,49
94. 	And the continuance of their parents' rage,45
95. 	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,55
96. 	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;45
97. 	The which if you with patient ears attend,44
98. 	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.54

110. SCENE I	Verona. A public place.32
111. 1
112. 1
113. 	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,54
114. 	armed with swords and bucklers]33
115. 1
116. SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.52
117. 1
118. GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.44
119. 1
120. SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.48
121. 1
122. GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.62
123. 1
124. SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.39
125. 1
126. GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.50
127. 1
128. SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.49
129. 1
130. GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:59
131. 	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.50
132. 1
133. SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will59
134. 	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.49
135. 1
136. GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes59
137. 	to the wall.14
138. 1
139. SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,61
140. 	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push52
141. 	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids52
142. 	to the wall.14
143. 1
144. GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.61
145. 1
146. SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I58
147. 	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the52
148. 	maids, and cut off their heads.33
149. 1
150. GREGORY	The heads of the maids?32
151. 1
152. SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;58
153. 	take it in what sense thou wilt.34
154. 1
155. GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.49
156. 1
157. SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and57
158. 	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.42
159. 1
160. GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou57
161. 	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes49
162. 	two of the house of the Montagues.36
163. 1
164. SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.59
165. 1
166. GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?36
167. 1
168. SAMPSON	Fear me not.21
169. 1
170. GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!32
171. 1
172. SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.58
173. 1
174. GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as59
175. 	they list.12
176. 1
177. SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;57
178. 	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.47
179. 1
180. 	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]31
181. 1
182. ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?43
183. 1
184. SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.33
185. 1
186. ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?43
187. 1
188. SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say61
189. 	ay?5
190. 1
191. GREGORY	No.12
192. 1
193. SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I59
194. 	bite my thumb, sir.21
195. 1
196. GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?29
197. 1
198. ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.30
199. 1
200. SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.68
201. 1
202. ABRAHAM	No better.19
203. 1
204. SAMPSON	Well, sir.19
205. 1
206. GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.61
207. 1
208. SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.26
209. 1
210. ABRAHAM	You lie.17
211. 1
212. SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.66
213. 1
214. 	[They fight]14
215. 1
216. 	[Enter BENVOLIO]18
217. 1
218. BENVOLIO	Part, fools!22
219. 	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.47
220. 1
221. 	[Beats down their swords]27
222. 1
223. 	[Enter TYBALT]16
224. 1
225. TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?57
226. 	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.43
227. 1
228. BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,52
229. 	Or manage it to part these men with me.41
230. 1
231. TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,56
232. 	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:42
233. 	Have at thee, coward!23
234. 1
235. 	[They fight]14
236. 1
237. 	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;52
238. 	then enter Citizens, with clubs]34
239. 1
240. First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!67
241. 	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!50
242. 1
243. 	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]47
244. 1
245. CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!55
246. 1
247. LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?59
248. 1
249. CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,47
250. 	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.42
251. 1
252. 	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]36
253. 1
254. MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.56
255. 1
256. LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.56
257. 1
258. 	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]33
259. 1
260. PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,46
261. 	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--46
262. 	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,52
263. 	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage46
264. 	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,48
265. 	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands45
266. 	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,47
267. 	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.45
268. 	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,43
269. 	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,37
270. 	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,49
271. 	And made Verona's ancient citizens36
272. 	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,42
273. 	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,42
274. 	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:50
275. 	If ever you disturb our streets again,40
276. 	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.48
277. 	For this time, all the rest depart away:42
278. 	You Capulet; shall go along with me:38
279. 	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,41
280. 	To know our further pleasure in this case,44
281. 	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.46
282. 	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.46
283. 1
284. 	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]56
285. 1
286. MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?51
287. 	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?43
288. 1
289. BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,51
290. 	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:47
291. 	I drew to part them: in the instant came42
292. 	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,44
293. 	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,44
294. 	He swung about his head and cut the winds,44
295. 	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:46
296. 	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,48
297. 	Came more and more and fought on part and part,49
298. 	Till the prince came, who parted either part.47
299. 1
300. LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?53
301. 	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.42
302. 1
303. BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun50
304. 	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,45
305. 	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;42
306. 	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore41
307. 	That westward rooteth from the city's side,45
308. 	So early walking did I see your son:38
309. 	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me43
310. 	And stole into the covert of the wood:40
311. 	I, measuring his affections by my own,40
312. 	That most are busied when they're most alone,47
313. 	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,37
314. 	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.45
315. 1
316. MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,49
317. 	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.46
318. 	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;51
319. 	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun41
320. 	Should in the furthest east begin to draw43
321. 	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,39
322. 	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,47
323. 	And private in his chamber pens himself,42
324. 	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out46
325. 	And makes himself an artificial night:40
326. 	Black and portentous must this humour prove,46
327. 	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.43
328. 1
329. BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?48
330. 1
331. MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.49
332. 1
333. BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?47
334. 1
335. MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:48
336. 	But he, his own affections' counsellor,41
337. 	Is to himself--I will not say how true--42
338. 	But to himself so secret and so close,40
339. 	So far from sounding and discovery,37
340. 	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,41
341. 	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,48
342. 	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.36
343. 	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.50
344. 	We would as willingly give cure as know.42
345. 1
346. 	[Enter ROMEO]15
347. 1
348. BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;57
349. 	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.45
350. 1
351. MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,49
352. 	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.47
353. 1
354. 	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]37
355. 1
356. BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.30
357. 1
358. ROMEO	Is the day so young?27
359. 1
360. BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.30
361. 1
362. ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.34
363. 	Was that my father that went hence so fast?45
364. 1
365. BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?55
366. 1
367. ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.56
368. 1
369. BENVOLIO	In love?18
370. 1
371. ROMEO	Out--12
372. 1
373. BENVOLIO	Of love?18
374. 1
375. ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.45
376. 1
377. BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,49
378. 	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!44
379. 1
380. ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,52
381. 	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!49
382. 	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?48
383. 	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.43
384. 	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.50
385. 	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!44
386. 	O any thing, of nothing first create!39
387. 	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!36
388. 	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!41
389. 	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,43
390. 	sick health!14
391. 	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!45
392. 	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.46
393. 	Dost thou not laugh?22
394. 1
395. BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.33
396. 1
397. ROMEO	Good heart, at what?27
398. 1
399. BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.41
400. 1
401. ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.41
402. 	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,44
403. 	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest45
404. 	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown52
405. 	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.46
406. 	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;48
407. 	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;49
408. 	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:49
409. 	What is it else? a madness most discreet,43
410. 	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.40
411. 	Farewell, my coz.19
412. 1
413. BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;50
414. 	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.41
415. 1
416. ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;46
417. 	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.43
418. 1
419. BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.51
420. 1
421. ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?41
422. 1
423. BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.25
424. 	But sadly tell me who.24
425. 1
426. ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:47
427. 	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!43
428. 	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.40
429. 1
430. BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.53
431. 1
432. ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.52
433. 1
434. BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.54
435. 1
436. ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit52
437. 	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;42
438. 	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,46
439. 	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.51
440. 	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,46
441. 	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,43
442. 	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:41
443. 	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,38
444. 	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.48
445. 1
446. BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?62
447. 1
448. ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,54
449. 	For beauty starved with her severity38
450. 	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.37
451. 	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,45
452. 	To merit bliss by making me despair:38
453. 	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow44
454. 	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.42
455. 1
456. BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.49
457. 1
458. ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.48
459. 1
460. BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;44
461. 	Examine other beauties.25
462. 1
463. ROMEO	'Tis the way19
464. 	To call hers exquisite, in question more:43
465. 	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows48
466. 	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;48
467. 	He that is strucken blind cannot forget41
468. 	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:45
469. 	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,42
470. 	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note43
471. 	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?48
472. 	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.46
473. 1
474. BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.54

496. 1
497. PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;44
498. 	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.42
499. 	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?44
500. 1
501. CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:49
502. 	My child is yet a stranger in the world;42
503. 	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,49
504. 	Let two more summers wither in their pride,45
505. 	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.42
506. 1
507. PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.47
508. 1
509. CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.53
510. 	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,48
511. 	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:38
512. 	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,43
513. 	My will to her consent is but a part;39
514. 	An she agree, within her scope of choice42
515. 	Lies my consent and fair according voice.43
516. 	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,44
517. 	Whereto I have invited many a guest,38
518. 	Such as I love; and you, among the store,43
519. 	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.47
520. 	At my poor house look to behold this night44
521. 	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:51
522. 	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel41
523. 	When well-apparell'd April on the heel40
524. 	Of limping winter treads, even such delight45
525. 	Among fresh female buds shall you this night46
526. 	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,41
527. 	And like her most whose merit most shall be:46
528. 	Which on more view, of many mine being one44
529. 	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,48
530. 	Come, go with me.19

544. 	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am53

667. 	What is your will?20
668. 1
669. LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,60
670. 	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;50
671. 	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.48
672. 	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.45
673. 1
674. Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.46
675. 1
676. LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.33
677. 1
678. Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--39
679. 	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--54
680. 	She is not fourteen. How long is it now41
681. 	To Lammas-tide?17
682. 1
683. LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.57
684. 1
685. Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,44
686. 	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.49
687. 	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--48
688. 	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;42
689. 	She was too good for me: but, as I said,42
690. 	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;47
691. 	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.44
692. 	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;45
693. 	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--49
694. 	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:45
695. 	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,41
696. 	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;47
697. 	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--40
698. 	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,42
699. 	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple46
700. 	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,44
701. 	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!45
702. 	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,52
703. 	To bid me trudge:19
704. 	And since that time it is eleven years;41
705. 	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,51
706. 	She could have run and waddled all about;43
707. 	For even the day before, she broke her brow:46
708. 	And then my husband--God be with his soul!44
709. 	A' was a merry man--took up the child:40
710. 	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?49
711. 	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;50
712. 	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,44
713. 	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'46
714. 	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!43
715. 	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,47
716. 	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;60
717. 	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'45
718. 1
719. LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.58
720. 1
721. Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,49
722. 	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'47
723. 	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow42
724. 	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;44
725. 	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:41
726. 	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?49
727. 	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;50
728. 	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'49
729. 1
730. JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.54
731. 1
732. Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!54
733. 	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:50
734. 	An I might live to see thee married once,43
735. 	I have my wish.17
736. 1
737. LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme51
738. 	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,46
739. 	How stands your disposition to be married?44
740. 1
741. JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.44
742. 1
743. Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,46
744. 	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.53
745. 1
746. LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,60
747. 	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,35
748. 	Are made already mothers: by my count,40
749. 	I was your mother much upon these years41
750. 	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:46
751. 	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.43
752. 1
753. Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man42
754. 	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.43
755. 1
756. LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.53
757. 1
758. Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.51
759. 1
760. LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?55
761. 	This night you shall behold him at our feast;47
762. 	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,44
763. 	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;48
764. 	Examine every married lineament,34
765. 	And see how one another lends content39
766. 	And what obscured in this fair volume lies44
767. 	Find written in the margent of his eyes.42
768. 	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,49
769. 	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:38
770. 	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride48
771. 	For fair without the fair within to hide:43
772. 	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,48
773. 	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;48
774. 	So shall you share all that he doth possess,46
775. 	By having him, making yourself no less.41
776. 1
777. Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.47
778. 1
779. LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?57
780. 1
781. JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:50
782. 	But no more deep will I endart mine eye41

819. 	Or shall we on without a apology?35
820. 1
821. BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:44

825. 	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke45

831. 	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.41
832. 1
833. MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.52
834. 1
835. ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes48
836. 	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead42
837. 	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.43
838. 1
839. MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,48
840. 	And soar with them above a common bound.42
841. 1
842. ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft45
843. 	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,48
844. 	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:40
845. 	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.38
846. 1
847. MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;53
848. 	Too great oppression for a tender thing.42
849. 1
850. ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,47
851. 	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.53
852. 1
853. MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;56
854. 	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.50
855. 	Give me a case to put my visage in:37
856. 	A visor for a visor! what care I34
857. 	What curious eye doth quote deformities?42
858. 	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.47

877. 	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.49

879. 	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.47

895. 1
896. MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.54
897. 	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes44
898. 	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone40
899. 	On the fore-finger of an alderman,36
900. 	Drawn with a team of little atomies37
901. 	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;41
902. 	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,46
903. 	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,41
904. 	The traces of the smallest spider's web,42
905. 	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,46
906. 	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,47
907. 	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,39
908. 	Not so big as a round little worm35
909. 	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;41
910. 	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut35
911. 	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,42
912. 	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.44
913. 	And in this state she gallops night by night46
914. 	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;54
915. 	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,59
916. 	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,52
917. 	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,51
918. 	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,48
919. 	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:52
920. 	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,46
921. 	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;44
922. 	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail48
923. 	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,45
924. 	Then dreams, he of another benefice:38
925. 	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,45
926. 	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,48
927. 	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,43
928. 	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon44
929. 	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,49
930. 	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two48
931. 	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab41
932. 	That plats the manes of horses in the night,46

934. 	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:46
935. 	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,49

937. 	Making them women of good carriage:37

941. 	Thou talk'st of nothing.26
942. 1
943. MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,33
944. 	Which are the children of an idle brain,42
945. 	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,36
946. 	Which is as thin of substance as the air42
947. 	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes46
948. 	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,41
949. 	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,45
950. 	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.45

952. BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;58
953. 	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.45
954. 1
955. ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives46
956. 	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars43
957. 	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date39
958. 	With this night's revels and expire the term46
959. 	Of a despised life closed in my breast40
960. 	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.41

1009. 	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,48
1010. 	She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?53
1011. 	Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day41
1012. 	That I have worn a visor and could tell41
1013. 	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,41
1014. 	Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:56
1015. 	You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.52
1016. 	A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.48

1018. 	[Music plays, and they dance]31
1019. 1
1020. 	More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,49
1021. 	And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.49
1022. 	Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.49
1023. 	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;42
1024. 	For you and I are past our dancing days:42
1025. 	How long is't now since last yourself and I45

1029. 1
1030. CAPULET	What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:55
1031. 	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,38
1032. 	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,39
1033. 	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.49
1034. 1
1035. Second Capulet	'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;60

1037. 1
1038. CAPULET	                  Will you tell me that?49

1044. 1
1045. Servant	I know not, sir.25
1046. 1
1047. ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!52
1048. 	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night44
1049. 	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;40
1050. 	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!46
1051. 	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,44
1052. 	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.40
1053. 	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,50
1054. 	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.48
1055. 	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!49
1056. 	For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.46
1057. 1
1058. TYBALT	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.49

1061. 	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?38

1066. 1
1067. TYBALT	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,43

1074. 1
1075. CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;49
1076. 	He bears him like a portly gentleman;39
1077. 	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him40
1078. 	To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:43
1079. 	I would not for the wealth of all the town44
1080. 	Here in my house do him disparagement:40
1081. 	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:44
1082. 	It is my will, the which if thou respect,43
1083. 	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,48
1084. 	And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.42
1085. 1
1086. TYBALT	It fits, when such a villain is a guest:48
1087. 	I'll not endure him.22
1088. 1
1089. CAPULET	He shall be endured:29
1090. 	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;44
1091. 	Am I the master here, or you? go to.38
1092. 	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!48
1093. 	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!39
1094. 	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!46
1095. 1
1096. TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.33
1097. 1
1098. CAPULET	Go to, go to;22
1099. 	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?39
1100. 	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:51
1101. 	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.41
1102. 	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:46
1103. 	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!50
1104. 	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!48
1105. 1
1106. TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting52
1107. 	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.53
1108. 	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall43
1109. 	Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.43

1113. ROMEO	[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand57
1114. 	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:44
1115. 	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand45
1116. 	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.48
1117. 1
1118. JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,54
1119. 	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;40
1120. 	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,54
1121. 	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.41
1122. 1
1123. ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?50
1124. 1
1125. JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.55
1126. 1
1127. ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;54
1128. 	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.52
1129. 1
1130. JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.59
1131. 1
1132. ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.54
1133. 	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.48
1134. 1
1135. JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.54
1136. 1
1137. ROMEO	Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!51
1138. 	Give me my sin again.23
1139. 1

1147. 	Her mother is the lady of the house,38
1148. 	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous42
1149. 	I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;48
1150. 	I tell you, he that can lay hold of her41
1151. 	Shall have the chinks.24
1152. 1

1161. 	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.45
1162. 	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all43
1163. 	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.44

1224. 	Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,41
1225. 	But to his foe supposed he must complain,43

1227. 	Being held a foe, he may not have access42
1228. 	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;46
1229. 	And she as much in love, her means much less46

1372. ROMEO	[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?60
1373. 1
1374. JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;43
1375. 	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.42
1376. 	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,44
1377. 	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part39
1378. 	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!44
1379. 	What's in a name? that which we call a rose45
1380. 	By any other name would smell as sweet;41
1381. 	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,43
1382. 	Retain that dear perfection which he owes43
1383. 	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,43
1384. 	And for that name which is no part of thee44
1385. 	Take all myself.18
1386. 1
1387. ROMEO	                  I take thee at thy word:49
1388. 	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;45
1389. 	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.35
1390. 1
1391. JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night55
1392. 	So stumblest on my counsel?29
1393. 1
1394. ROMEO	By a name16
1395. 	I know not how to tell thee who I am:39
1396. 	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,44
1397. 	Because it is an enemy to thee;33
1398. 	Had I it written, I would tear the word.42
1399. 1
1400. JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words50
1401. 	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:51
1402. 	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?36
1403. 1
1404. ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.51
1405. 1
1406. JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?55
1407. 	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,47
1408. 	And the place death, considering who thou art,48
1409. 	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.38
1410. 1
1411. ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;60
1412. 	For stony limits cannot hold love out,40
1413. 	And what love can do that dares love attempt;47
1414. 	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.41
1415. 1
1416. JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.51
1417. 1
1418. ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye48
1419. 	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,51
1420. 	And I am proof against their enmity.38
1421. 1
1422. JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.53
1423. 1
1424. ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;56
1425. 	And but thou love me, let them find me here:46
1426. 	My life were better ended by their hate,42
1427. 	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.44
1428. 1
1429. JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?56
1430. 1
1431. ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;51
1432. 	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.41
1433. 	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far38
1434. 	As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,50
1435. 	I would adventure for such merchandise.41
1436. 1
1437. JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,53
1438. 	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek44
1439. 	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night50
1440. 	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny45
1441. 	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!45
1442. 	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'47
1443. 	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,49
1444. 	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries46
1445. 	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,40
1446. 	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:45
1447. 	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,43
1448. 	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,45
1449. 	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.48
1450. 	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,41
1451. 	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:50
1452. 	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true47
1453. 	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.50
1454. 	I should have been more strange, I must confess,50
1455. 	But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,45
1456. 	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,46
1457. 	And not impute this yielding to light love,45
1458. 	Which the dark night hath so discovered.42
1459. 1
1460. ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear43
1461. 	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--51
1462. 1
1463. JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,54
1464. 	That monthly changes in her circled orb,42
1465. 	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.45
1466. 1
1467. ROMEO	What shall I swear by?29
1468. 1
1469. JULIET	Do not swear at all;28
1470. 	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,47
1471. 	Which is the god of my idolatry,34
1472. 	And I'll believe thee.24
1473. 1
1474. ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--32
1475. 1
1476. JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,51
1477. 	I have no joy of this contract to-night:42
1478. 	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;44
1479. 	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be48
1480. 	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!51
1481. 	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,48
1482. 	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.49
1483. 	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest50
1484. 	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!45
1485. 1
1486. ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?44
1487. 1
1488. JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?51
1489. 1
1490. ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.56
1491. 1
1492. JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:54
1493. 	And yet I would it were to give again.40
1494. 1
1495. ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?56
1496. 1
1497. JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.48
1498. 	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:42
1499. 	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,39
1500. 	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,43
1501. 	The more I have, for both are infinite.41
1502. 1
1503. 	[Nurse calls within]22
1504. 1
1505. 	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!45
1506. 	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.44
1507. 	Stay but a little, I will come again.39
1508. 1
1509. 	[Exit, above]15
1510. 1
1511. ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.45

1514. 1
1515. 	[Re-enter JULIET, above]26
1516. 1

1518. 	If that thy bent of love be honourable,41
1519. 	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,47
1520. 	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,43
1521. 	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;49
1522. 	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay42
1523. 	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.47

1531. 1
1532. JULIET	By and by, I come:--28

1534. 	To-morrow will I send.24
1535. 1

1539. 1
1540. 	[Exit, above]15
1541. 1
1542. ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.53
1543. 	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from43
1544. 	their books,14
1545. 	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.53

1553. 	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;45
1554. 	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,45
1555. 	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,49
1556. 	With repetition of my Romeo's name.37
1557. 1
1558. ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:45

1567. 	Shall I send to thee?23

1569. ROMEO	At the hour of nine.27
1570. 1
1571. JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.53
1572. 	I have forgot why I did call thee back.41
1573. 1
1574. ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.47
1575. 1
1576. JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,55
1577. 	Remembering how I love thy company.37
1578. 1

1580. 	Forgetting any other home but this.37
1581. 1
1582. JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:52
1583. 	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;42
1584. 	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,41
1585. 	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,44
1586. 	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,46

1620. 1
1621. FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,64
1622. 	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,54
1623. 	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels44
1624. 	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:49
1625. 	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,43
1626. 	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,47
1627. 	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours40
1628. 	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.49
1629. 	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;47
1630. 	What is her burying grave that is her womb,45
1631. 	And from her womb children of divers kind43
1632. 	We sucking on her natural bosom find,39
1633. 	Many for many virtues excellent,34
1634. 	None but for some and yet all different.42
1635. 	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies43
1636. 	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:53
1637. 	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live48
1638. 	But to the earth some special good doth give,47
1639. 	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use51
1640. 	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:46
1641. 	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;45
1642. 	And vice sometimes by action dignified.41
1643. 	Within the infant rind of this small flower45
1644. 	Poison hath residence and medicine power:43
1645. 	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;57
1646. 	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.48
1647. 	Two such opposed kings encamp them still42
1648. 	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;47
1649. 	And where the worser is predominant,38
1650. 	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.48
1651. 1
1652. 	[Enter ROMEO]15
1653. 1
1654. ROMEO	Good morrow, father.27
1655. 1
1656. FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!27
1657. 	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?41
1658. 	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head41
1659. 	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:40
1660. 	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,46
1661. 	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;46
1662. 	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain48
1663. 	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:54
1664. 	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure40
1665. 	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;44
1666. 	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,41
1667. 	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.42
1668. 1
1669. ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.52
1670. 1
1671. FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?56
1672. 1
1673. ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;44
1674. 	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.47
1675. 1
1676. FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?67
1677. 1
1678. ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.48
1679. 	I have been feasting with mine enemy,39
1680. 	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,40
1681. 	That's by me wounded: both our remedies41
1682. 	Within thy help and holy physic lies:39
1683. 	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,41
1684. 	My intercession likewise steads my foe.41
1685. 1
1686. FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;60
1687. 	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.48
1688. 1
1689. ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set52
1690. 	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:39
1691. 	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;42
1692. 	And all combined, save what thou must combine47
1693. 	By holy marriage: when and where and how42
1694. 	We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,44
1695. 	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,45
1696. 	That thou consent to marry us to-day.39
1697. 1
1698. FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!58
1699. 	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,44
1700. 	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies46
1701. 	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.47
1702. 	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine34
1703. 	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!45
1704. 	How much salt water thrown away in waste,43
1705. 	To season love, that of it doth not taste!44
1706. 	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,47
1707. 	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;45
1708. 	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit44
1709. 	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:44
1710. 	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,49
1711. 	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:44
1712. 	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,53
1713. 	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.50
1714. 1
1715. ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.47
1716. 1
1717. FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.55
1718. 1
1719. ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.31
1720. 1
1721. FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,31
1722. 	To lay one in, another out to have.37
1723. 1
1724. ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now50
1725. 	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;47
1726. 	The other did not so.23
1727. 1
1728. FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well32
1729. 	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.48
1730. 	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,44
1731. 	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;39
1732. 	For this alliance may so happy prove,39
1733. 	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.48
1734. 1

1775. 1
1776. MERCUTIO	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a61
1777. 	white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a54
1778. 	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the53

1787. 	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and52
1788. 	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk53
1789. 	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the52

1798. 	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good49
1799. 	whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,46
1800. 	grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with50
1801. 	these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these51
1802. 	perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,50
1803. 	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their53
1804. 	bones, their bones!21

1809. 1
1810. MERCUTIO	Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,62
1811. 	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers51
1812. 	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a54
1813. 	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to48
1814. 	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;48
1815. 	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey52
1816. 	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior44
1817. 	Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation46
1818. 	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit50
1819. 	fairly last night.20
1820. 1
1821. ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?64
1822. 1
1823. MERCUTIO	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?56
1824. 1
1825. ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in59
1826. 	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.48
1827. 1
1828. MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours56
1829. 	constrains a man to bow in the hams.38
1830. 1
1831. ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.28
1832. 1
1833. MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.39
1834. 1
1835. ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.35
1836. 1
1837. MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.46
1838. 1
1839. ROMEO	Pink for flower.23
1840. 1
1841. MERCUTIO	Right.16
1842. 1
1843. ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.42
1844. 1
1845. MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast59
1846. 	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it52
1847. 	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.63
1848. 1
1849. ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the51
1850. 	singleness.13
1851. 1
1852. MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.56
1853. 1
1854. ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.63
1855. 1
1856. MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have59
1857. 	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of54
1858. 	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:52
1859. 	was I with you there for the goose?37
1860. 1
1861. ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast59
1862. 	not there for the goose.26
1863. 1
1864. MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.52
1865. 1
1866. ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.33
1867. 1
1868. MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most57
1869. 	sharp sauce.14
1870. 1
1871. ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?53
1872. 1
1873. MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an60
1874. 	inch narrow to an ell broad!30
1875. 1
1876. ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added58
1877. 	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.55
1878. 1
1879. MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?61
1880. 	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art52
1881. 	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:50
1882. 	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,51
1883. 	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.61
1884. 1
1885. BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.33
1886. 1
1887. MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.63
1888. 1
1889. BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.53
1890. 1
1891. MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:59
1892. 	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and51
1893. 	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.50
1894. 1

1928. 	may find the young Romeo?27
1929. 1
1930. ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when57
1931. 	you have found him than he was when you sought him:53
1932. 	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.55
1933. 1
1934. Nurse	You say well.20
1935. 1
1936. MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;59
1937. 	wisely, wisely.17

1945. 1
1946. ROMEO	What hast thou found?28
1947. 1
1948. MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,60
1949. 	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.51
1950. 1
1951. 	[Sings]9
1952. 1
1953. 	An old hare hoar,19

1955. 	Is very good meat in lent27
1956. 	But a hare that is hoar25
1957. 	Is too much for a score,26
1958. 	When it hoars ere it be spent.32
1959. 	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll46
1960. 	to dinner, thither.21

1974. 1
1975. ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,59
1976. 	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand52
1977. 	to in a month.16
1978. 1
1979. Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him54
1980. 	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such54
1981. 	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.53
1982. 	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am50
1983. 	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by50
1984. 	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?56
1985. 1
1986. PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon59
1987. 	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare53
1988. 	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a53
1989. 	good quarrel, and the law on my side.39
1990. 1
1991. Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about59
1992. 	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:50
1993. 	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you54
1994. 	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:51
1995. 	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into54
1996. 	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross54
1997. 	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman52
1998. 	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double53
1999. 	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered52
2000. 	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.44
2001. 1
2002. ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I52
2003. 	protest unto thee--21
2004. 1
2005. Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:58
2006. 	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.41
2007. 1
2008. ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.61
2009. 1
2010. Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as59
2011. 	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.38
2012. 1
2013. ROMEO	Bid her devise21
2014. 	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;46
2015. 	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell45
2016. 	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.48
2017. 1
2018. Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.33
2019. 1
2020. ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.30
2021. 1
2022. Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.53
2023. 1
2024. ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:51
2025. 	Within this hour my man shall be with thee44
2026. 	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;49
2027. 	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy41
2028. 	Must be my convoy in the secret night.40
2029. 	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:47
2030. 	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.39
2031. 1
2032. Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.51

2040. 1
2041. NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,57
2042. 	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there52
2043. 	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain51
2044. 	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief51
2045. 	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her50
2046. 	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer51
2047. 	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks54
2048. 	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not52
2049. 	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?46
2050. 1
2051. ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.47

2054. 	the--No; I know it begins with some other43
2055. 	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of52
2056. 	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good52
2057. 	to hear it.13

2136. 1
2137. Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not56
2138. 	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his52
2139. 	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels51

2141. 	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are50
2142. 	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,49
2143. 	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy52

2230. 	A lover may bestride the gossamer35
2231. 	That idles in the wanton summer air,38
2232. 	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.39
2233. 1
2234. JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.42
2235. 1
2236. FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.62
2237. 1
2238. JULIET	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.52
2239. 1
2240. ROMEO	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy44
2241. 	Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more48
2242. 	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath44
2243. 	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue49
2244. 	Unfold the imagined happiness that both41
2245. 	Receive in either by this dear encounter.43
2246. 1
2247. JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,51
2248. 	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:42
2249. 	They are but beggars that can count their worth;50
2250. 	But my true love is grown to such excess42
2251. 	I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.40
2252. 1
2253. FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;64
2254. 	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone47

2270. 1
2271. 1
2272. 	[Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants]48
2273. 1
2274. BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:51
2275. 	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,38
2276. 	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;46
2277. 	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.53
2278. 1
2279. MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he57
2280. 	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword52
2281. 	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of49
2282. 	thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws53
2283. 	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.49
2284. 1
2285. BENVOLIO	Am I like such a fellow?34
2286. 1
2287. MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as59
2288. 	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as53
2289. 	soon moody to be moved.25
2290. 1
2291. BENVOLIO	And what to?22
2292. 1
2293. MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none58
2294. 	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,51
2295. 	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,53
2296. 	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou52
2297. 	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no54
2298. 	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what53
2299. 	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?51
2300. 	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of53
2301. 	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as53
2302. 	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a53
2303. 	man for coughing in the street, because he hath49
2304. 	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:51
2305. 	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing51
2306. 	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for50
2307. 	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou51
2308. 	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!33
2309. 1
2310. BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man58
2311. 	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.65
2312. 1
2313. MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!35
2314. 1
2315. BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.45
2316. 1
2317. MERCUTIO	By my heel, I care not.33
2318. 1
2319. 	[Enter TYBALT and others]27
2320. 1
2321. TYBALT	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.50
2322. 	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.46
2323. 1
2324. MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with57
2325. 	something; make it a word and a blow.39
2326. 1
2327. TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you57
2328. 	will give me occasion.24
2329. 1
2330. MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?58
2331. 1
2332. TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--47
2333. 1
2334. MERCUTIO	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an56
2335. 	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but53
2336. 	discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall52
2337. 	make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!35
2338. 1
2339. BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:50
2340. 	Either withdraw unto some private place,42
2341. 	And reason coldly of your grievances,39
2342. 	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.43
2343. 1
2344. MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;58
2345. 	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.44
2346. 1
2347. 	[Enter ROMEO]15
2348. 1
2349. TYBALT	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.56
2350. 1
2351. MERCUTIO	But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:58
2352. 	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;52
2353. 	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'48
2354. 1
2355. TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford46
2356. 	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.48
2357. 1
2358. ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee50
2359. 	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage40
2360. 	To such a greeting: villain am I none;40
2361. 	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.48
2362. 1
2363. TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries47
2364. 	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.50
2365. 1
2366. ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,42
2367. 	But love thee better than thou canst devise,46
2368. 	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:45
2369. 	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender44
2370. 	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.37
2371. 1
2372. MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!49
2373. 	Alla stoccata carries it away.32

2378. 1
2379. TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?39
2380. 1
2381. MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine57
2382. 	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you52
2383. 	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the49
2384. 	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher53
2385. 	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your50
2386. 	ears ere it be out.21
2387. 1
2388. TYBALT	I am for you.21

2396. 	[They fight]14

2398. ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.47
2399. 	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!45
2400. 	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath45
2401. 	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:39
2402. 	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!30
2403. 1
2404. 	[TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies53
2405. 	with his followers]21
2406. 1
2407. MERCUTIO	I am hurt.20
2408. 	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.42
2409. 	Is he gone, and hath nothing?31
2410. 1
2411. BENVOLIO	What, art thou hurt?30
2412. 1
2413. MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.59
2414. 	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.49
2415. 1
2416. 	[Exit Page]13
2417. 1
2418. ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.45
2419. 1
2420. MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a58
2421. 	church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for52
2422. 	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I52
2423. 	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'53
2424. 	both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a53
2425. 	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a47
2426. 	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of46
2427. 	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I50
2428. 	was hurt under your arm.26
2429. 1
2430. ROMEO	I thought all for the best.34
2431. 1
2432. MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,44
2433. 	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!49
2434. 	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,46
2435. 	And soundly too: your houses!31

2438. 1
2439. ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,46
2440. 	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt42
2441. 	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd37
2442. 	With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour46
2443. 	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,39
2444. 	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate36
2445. 	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!43
2446. 1
2447. 	[Re-enter BENVOLIO]21
2448. 1

2450. 	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,46
2451. 	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.46
2452. 1
2453. ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;54
2454. 	This but begins the woe, others must end.43
2455. 1
2456. BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.51
2457. 1

2461. 1
2462. 	[Re-enter TYBALT]19
2463. 1
2464. 	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,43
2465. 	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul47
2466. 	Is but a little way above our heads,38
2467. 	Staying for thine to keep him company:40
2468. 	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.47
2469. 1
2470. TYBALT	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,56
2471. 	Shalt with him hence.23

2493. BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.33

2502. 1
2503. BENVOLIO	O noble prince, I can discover all44
2504. 	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:41
2505. 	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,43
2506. 	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.40
2507. 1
2508. LADY CAPULET	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!54
2509. 	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt52
2510. 	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,46
2511. 	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.44
2512. 	O cousin, cousin!19
2513. 1
2514. PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?45
2515. 1
2516. BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;57
2517. 	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink45
2518. 	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal44
2519. 	Your high displeasure: all this uttered41
2520. 	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,52
2521. 	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen45
2522. 	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts44
2523. 	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,48
2524. 	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,46
2525. 	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats48
2526. 	Cold death aside, and with the other sends44
2527. 	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,37
2528. 	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,35
2529. 	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than51
2530. 	his tongue,13
2531. 	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,46
2532. 	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm46
2533. 	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life44
2534. 	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;42
2535. 	But by and by comes back to Romeo,36
2536. 	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,40
2537. 	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I46
2538. 	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.50
2539. 	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.42
2540. 	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.41
2541. 1
2542. LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;46
2543. 	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:48
2544. 	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,50
2545. 	And all those twenty could but kill one life.47
2546. 	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;51
2547. 	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.41
2548. 1
2549. PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;41
2550. 	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?47
2551. 1
2552. MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;54
2553. 	His fault concludes but what the law should end,50
2554. 	The life of Tybalt.21
2555. 1
2556. PRINCE	And for that offence28
2557. 	Immediately we do exile him hence:36
2558. 	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,47
2559. 	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;52
2560. 	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine43
2561. 	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:45
2562. 	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;41
2563. 	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:50
2564. 	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,47
2565. 	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.47
2566. 	Bear hence this body and attend our will:43
2567. 	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.47

2586. JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,46
2587. 	Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner42
2588. 	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,41
2589. 	And bring in cloudy night immediately.40
2590. 	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,50
2591. 	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo40
2592. 	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.45
2593. 	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites42
2594. 	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,46
2595. 	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,47
2596. 	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,41
2597. 	And learn me how to lose a winning match,43
2598. 	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:45
2599. 	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,46
2600. 	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,55
2601. 	Think true love acted simple modesty.39
2602. 	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;52
2603. 	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night43

2606. 	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,43
2607. 	Take him and cut him out in little stars,43
2608. 	And he will make the face of heaven so fine45
2609. 	That all the world will be in love with night47
2610. 	And pay no worship to the garish sun.39
2611. 	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,41
2612. 	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,46
2613. 	Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day41
2614. 	As is the night before some festival38
2615. 	To an impatient child that hath new robes43
2616. 	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,48
2617. 	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks51

2638. 	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!39
2639. 	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!40
2640. 1
2641. JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?55
2642. 	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.47
2643. 	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'45
2644. 	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more43

2652. 	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:47
2653. 	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;42
2654. 	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,45
2655. 	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.45
2656. 1
2657. JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!57
2658. 	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!41
2659. 	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;47
2660. 	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!42
2661. 1
2662. Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!47
2663. 	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!39
2664. 	That ever I should live to see thee dead!43
2665. 1
2666. JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?50
2667. 	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?43
2668. 	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?43
2669. 	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!49
2670. 	For who is living, if those two are gone?43
2671. 1
2672. Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;42
2673. 	Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.40
2674. 1
2675. JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?52
2676. 1
2677. Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!44
2678. 1
2679. JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!51
2680. 	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?38
2681. 	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!36
2682. 	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!46
2683. 	Despised substance of divinest show!38
2684. 	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,44
2685. 	A damned saint, an honourable villain!40
2686. 	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,42
2687. 	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend45
2688. 	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?40
2689. 	Was ever book containing such vile matter43
2690. 	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell45
2691. 	In such a gorgeous palace!28
2692. 1
2693. Nurse	There's no trust,24
2694. 	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,44
2695. 	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.44
2696. 	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:46
2697. 	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.54
2698. 	Shame come to Romeo!22
2699. 1
2700. JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue31
2701. 	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:44
2702. 	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;40
2703. 	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd47
2704. 	Sole monarch of the universal earth.38
2705. 	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!40
2706. 1
2707. Nurse	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?58
2708. 1
2709. JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?52
2710. 	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,54
2711. 	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?48
2712. 	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?53
2713. 	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:51
2714. 	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;50
2715. 	Your tributary drops belong to woe,37
2716. 	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.40
2717. 	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;49
2718. 	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:54
2719. 	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?45
2720. 	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,50
2721. 	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;43
2722. 	But, O, it presses to my memory,34
2723. 	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:45
2724. 	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'40
2725. 	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'44
2726. 	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death49
2727. 	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:40
2728. 	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship40
2729. 	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,46
2730. 	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'50
2731. 	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,42
2732. 	Which modern lamentations might have moved?45
2733. 	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,48
2734. 	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,42
2735. 	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,43
2736. 	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'43
2737. 	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,44
2738. 	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.52
2739. 	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?43
2740. 1
2741. Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:47
2742. 	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.48
2743. 1
2744. JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,61
2745. 	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.46
2746. 	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,52
2747. 	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:38
2748. 	He made you for a highway to my bed;38
2749. 	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.36
2750. 	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;51
2751. 	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!43
2752. 1
2753. Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo43
2754. 	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.41
2755. 	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:44
2756. 	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.43
2757. 1
2758. JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,54
2759. 	And bid him come to take his last farewell.45

2774. 1
2775. 1
2776. 	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]24
2777. 1
2778. FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:64
2779. 	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,39
2780. 	And thou art wedded to calamity.34
2781. 1
2782. 	[Enter ROMEO]15
2783. 1
2784. ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?52
2785. 	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,45
2786. 	That I yet know not?22
2787. 1
2788. FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar28
2789. 	Is my dear son with such sour company:40
2790. 	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.44
2791. 1
2792. ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?53
2793. 1
2794. FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,58
2795. 	Not body's death, but body's banishment.42
2796. 1
2797. ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'48
2798. 	For exile hath more terror in his look,41
2799. 	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'48
2800. 1
2801. FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:52
2802. 	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.46
2803. 1
2804. ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,46
2805. 	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.38
2806. 	Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,44
2807. 	And world's exile is death: then banished,44
2808. 	Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,48
2809. 	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,45
2810. 	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.46
2811. 1
2812. FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!52
2813. 	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,53
2814. 	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,45
2815. 	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:49
2816. 	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.44
2817. 1
2818. ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,51
2819. 	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog43
2820. 	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,41
2821. 	Live here in heaven and may look on her;42
2822. 	But Romeo may not: more validity,35
2823. 	More honourable state, more courtship lives45
2824. 	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize44
2825. 	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand43
2826. 	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,44
2827. 	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,38
2828. 	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;48
2829. 	But Romeo may not; he is banished:36
2830. 	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:46
2831. 	They are free men, but I am banished.39
2832. 	And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?46
2833. 	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,52
2834. 	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,48
2835. 	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?41
2836. 	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;44
2837. 	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,46
2838. 	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,38
2839. 	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,42
2840. 	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?41
2841. 1
2842. FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.60
2843. 1
2844. ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.46
2845. 1
2846. FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:60
2847. 	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,37
2848. 	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.44
2849. 1
2850. ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!42
2851. 	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,38
2852. 	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,43
2853. 	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.46
2854. 1
2855. FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.55
2856. 1
2857. ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?56
2858. 1
2859. FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.55
2860. 1
2861. ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:55
2862. 	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,43
2863. 	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,39
2864. 	Doting like me and like me banished,38
2865. 	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,59
2866. 	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,40
2867. 	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.40
2868. 1
2869. 	[Knocking within]19
2870. 1
2871. FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.60
2872. 1
2873. ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,52
2874. 	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.47
2875. 1
2876. 	[Knocking]12
2877. 1
2878. FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;64
2879. 	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;44
2880. 1
2881. 	[Knocking]12
2882. 1
2883. 	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,41
2884. 	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!42
2885. 1
2886. 	[Knocking]12
2887. 1
2888. 	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?56
2889. 1
2890. Nurse	[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know51
2891. 	my errand;12
2892. 	I come from Lady Juliet.26
2893. 1
2894. FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.30
2895. 1
2896. 	[Enter Nurse]15
2897. 1
2898. Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,44
2899. 	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?41
2900. 1
2901. FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.67
2902. 1
2903. Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,42
2904. 	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!37
2905. 	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,40
2906. 	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.49
2907. 	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:46
2908. 	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;50
2909. 	Why should you fall into so deep an O?40
2910. 1
2911. ROMEO	Nurse!13
2912. 1
2913. Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.52
2914. 1
2915. ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?50
2916. 	Doth she not think me an old murderer,40
2917. 	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy45
2918. 	With blood removed but little from her own?45
2919. 	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says47
2920. 	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?42
2921. 1
2922. Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;53
2923. 	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,47
2924. 	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,44
2925. 	And then down falls again.28
2926. 1
2927. ROMEO	As if that name,23
2928. 	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,38
2929. 	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand44
2930. 	Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,51
2931. 	In what vile part of this anatomy35
2932. 	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack46
2933. 	The hateful mansion.22
2934. 1
2935. 	[Drawing his sword]21
2936. 1
2937. FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:40
2938. 	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:46
2939. 	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote46
2940. 	The unreasonable fury of a beast:35
2941. 	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!34
2942. 	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!41
2943. 	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,40
2944. 	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.44
2945. 	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?49
2946. 	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,43
2947. 	By doing damned hate upon thyself?36
2948. 	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?55
2949. 	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet55
2950. 	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.51
2951. 	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;54
2952. 	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,41
2953. 	And usest none in that true use indeed40
2954. 	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:51
2955. 	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,39
2956. 	Digressing from the valour of a man;38
2957. 	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,41
2958. 	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;53
2959. 	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,43
2960. 	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,40
2961. 	Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,44
2962. 	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,38
2963. 	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.46
2964. 	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,45
2965. 	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;48
2966. 	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,47
2967. 	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:52
2968. 	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend50
2969. 	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:46
2970. 	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;46
2971. 	Happiness courts thee in her best array;42
2972. 	But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,42
2973. 	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:45
2974. 	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.47
2975. 	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,43
2976. 	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:44
2977. 	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,47
2978. 	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;41
2979. 	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time48
2980. 	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,49
2981. 	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back46
2982. 	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy45
2983. 	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.41
2984. 	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;43
2985. 	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,42
2986. 	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:41
2987. 	Romeo is coming.18
2988. 1
2989. Nurse	O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night53
2990. 	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!44
2991. 	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.43
2992. 1
2993. ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.48
2994. 1
2995. Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:50
2996. 	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.46

3000. ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this!46
3001. 1
3002. FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:69
3003. 	Either be gone before the watch be set,41
3004. 	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:46
3005. 	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,44
3006. 	And he shall signify from time to time40
3007. 	Every good hap to you that chances here:42
3008. 	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.52
3009. 1
3010. ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,47
3011. 	It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.56

3030. CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,51
3031. 	That we have had no time to move our daughter:48
3032. 	Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,48
3033. 	And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.43
3034. 	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:48
3035. 	I promise you, but for your company,38
3036. 	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.38

3043. 1
3044. CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender50
3045. 	Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled47
3046. 	In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.51
3047. 	Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;40
3048. 	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;42
3049. 	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--47
3050. 	But, soft! what day is this?30
3051. 1

3054. CAPULET	Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,53
3055. 	O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,47
3056. 	She shall be married to this noble earl.42
3057. 	Will you be ready? do you like this haste?44
3058. 	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;44
3059. 	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,44
3060. 	It may be thought we held him carelessly,43
3061. 	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:38
3062. 	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,49
3063. 	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?49
3064. 1
3065. PARIS	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.53
3066. 1
3067. CAPULET	Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.52
3068. 	Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,37
3069. 	Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.46
3070. 	Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!45
3071. 	Afore me! it is so very very late,36
3072. 	That we may call it early by and by.38
3073. 	Good night.13

3087. SCENE V	Capulet's orchard.27
3088. 1
3089. 1
3090. 	[Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window]47
3091. 1
3092. JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:50
3093. 	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,43
3094. 	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;47
3095. 	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:44
3096. 	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.43
3097. 1
3098. ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,47
3099. 	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks50
3100. 	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:45
3101. 	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day47
3102. 	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.43
3103. 	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.43
3104. 1
3105. JULIET	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:49
3106. 	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,41
3107. 	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,42
3108. 	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:38
3109. 	Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.50
3110. 1
3111. ROMEO	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;47
3112. 	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.40
3113. 	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,45
3114. 	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;45
3115. 	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat47
3116. 	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:44
3117. 	I have more care to stay than will to go:43
3118. 	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.47
3119. 	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.47
3120. 1
3121. JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!47
3122. 	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,43
3123. 	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.49
3124. 	Some say the lark makes sweet division;41
3125. 	This doth not so, for she divideth us:40
3126. 	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,49
3127. 	O, now I would they had changed voices too!45
3128. 	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,47
3129. 	Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,47
3130. 	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.48
3131. 1
3132. ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!57
3133. 1
3134. 	[Enter Nurse, to the chamber]31
3135. 1
3136. Nurse	Madam!13
3137. 1
3138. JULIET	Nurse?14
3139. 1
3140. Nurse	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:50
3141. 	The day is broke; be wary, look about.40
3142. 1
3143. 	[Exit]8
3144. 1
3145. JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.51
3146. 1
3147. ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.54
3148. 1
3149. 	[He goeth down]17
3150. 1
3151. JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!58
3152. 	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,46
3153. 	For in a minute there are many days:38
3154. 	O, by this count I shall be much in years43
3155. 	Ere I again behold my Romeo!30
3156. 1
3157. ROMEO	Farewell!16
3158. 	I will omit no opportunity28
3159. 	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.46
3160. 1
3161. JULIET	O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?49
3162. 1
3163. ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve53
3164. 	For sweet discourses in our time to come.43
3165. 1
3166. JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!43
3167. 	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,42
3168. 	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:38
3169. 	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.49
3170. 1
3171. ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:47
3172. 	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!44
3173. 1
3174. 	[Exit]8
3175. 1
3176. JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:53
3177. 	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.46
3178. 	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;49
3179. 	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,48
3180. 	But send him back.20
3181. 1
3182. LADY CAPULET	[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?56
3183. 1
3184. JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?50
3185. 	Is she not down so late, or up so early?42
3186. 	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?46
3187. 1
3188. 	[Enter LADY CAPULET]22
3189. 1
3190. LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!35
3191. 1
3192. JULIET	Madam, I am not well.29
3193. 1
3194. LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?55
3195. 	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?53
3196. 	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;53
3197. 	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;54
3198. 	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.49
3199. 1
3200. JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.48
3201. 1
3202. LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend60
3203. 	Which you weep for.21
3204. 1
3205. JULIET	Feeling so the loss,28
3206. 	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.41
3207. 1
3208. LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,65
3209. 	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.50
3210. 1
3211. JULIET	What villain madam?27
3212. 1
3213. LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.39
3214. 1
3215. JULIET	[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--56
3216. 	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;42
3217. 	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.46
3218. 1
3219. LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.58
3220. 1
3221. JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:52
3222. 	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!49
3223. 1
3224. LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:59
3225. 	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,48
3226. 	Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,46
3227. 	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,43
3228. 	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:41
3229. 	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.43
3230. 1
3231. JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied42
3232. 	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--39
3233. 	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.39
3234. 	Madam, if you could find out but a man40
3235. 	To bear a poison, I would temper it;38
3236. 	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,42
3237. 	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors45
3238. 	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.44
3239. 	To wreak the love I bore my cousin36
3240. 	Upon his body that slaughter'd him!37
3241. 1
3242. LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.60
3243. 	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.46
3244. 1
3245. JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:48
3246. 	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?41
3247. 1
3248. LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;60
3249. 	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,42
3250. 	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,38
3251. 	That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.47
3252. 1
3253. JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?47
3254. 1
3255. LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,56
3256. 	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,41
3257. 	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,44
3258. 	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.47
3259. 1
3260. JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,51
3261. 	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.44
3262. 	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed41
3263. 	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.47
3264. 	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,45
3265. 	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,48
3266. 	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,42
3267. 	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!43
3268. 1
3269. LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,59
3270. 	And see how he will take it at your hands.44
3271. 1
3272. 	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]27
3273. 1
3274. CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;53
3275. 	But for the sunset of my brother's son40
3276. 	It rains downright.21
3277. 	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?49
3278. 	Evermore showering? In one little body40
3279. 	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;44
3280. 	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,47
3281. 	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,51
3282. 	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;51
3283. 	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,49
3284. 	Without a sudden calm, will overset37
3285. 	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!41
3286. 	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?39
3287. 1
3288. LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.63
3289. 	I would the fool were married to her grave!45
3290. 1
3291. CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.56
3292. 	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?50
3293. 	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,49
3294. 	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought42
3295. 	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?45
3296. 1
3297. JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:57
3298. 	Proud can I never be of what I hate;38
3299. 	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.49
3300. 1
3301. CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?52
3302. 	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'52
3303. 	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,44
3304. 	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,49
3305. 	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,52
3306. 	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,43
3307. 	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.42
3308. 	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!52
3309. 	You tallow-face!18
3310. 1
3311. LADY CAPULET	                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?60
3312. 1
3313. JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,47
3314. 	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.44
3315. 1
3316. CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!54
3317. 	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,51
3318. 	Or never after look me in the face:37
3319. 	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;41
3320. 	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest51
3321. 	That God had lent us but this only child;43
3322. 	But now I see this one is one too much,41
3323. 	And that we have a curse in having her:41
3324. 	Out on her, hilding!22
3325. 1
3326. Nurse	God in heaven bless her!31
3327. 	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.44
3328. 1
3329. CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,51
3330. 	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.47
3331. 1
3332. Nurse	I speak no treason.26
3333. 1
3334. CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.27
3335. 1
3336. Nurse	May not one speak?25
3337. 1
3338. CAPULET	                  Peace, you mumbling fool!52
3339. 	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;42
3340. 	For here we need it not.26
3341. 1
3342. LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.30
3343. 1
3344. CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:38
3345. 	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,43
3346. 	Alone, in company, still my care hath been44
3347. 	To have her match'd: and having now provided46
3348. 	A gentleman of noble parentage,33
3349. 	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,48
3350. 	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,46
3351. 	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;49
3352. 	And then to have a wretched puling fool,42
3353. 	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,44
3354. 	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,41
3355. 	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'41
3356. 	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:44
3357. 	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:51
3358. 	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.46
3359. 	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:46
3360. 	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;45
3361. 	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in43
3362. 	the streets,14
3363. 	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,47
3364. 	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:44
3365. 	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.48

3368. 1
3369. JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,47
3370. 	That sees into the bottom of my grief?40
3371. 	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!39
3372. 	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;42
3373. 	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed40
3374. 	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.41
3375. 1
3376. LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:56
3377. 	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.45
3378. 1
3379. 	[Exit]8
3380. 1
3381. JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?53
3382. 	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;45
3383. 	How shall that faith return again to earth,45
3384. 	Unless that husband send it me from heaven44
3385. 	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.43
3386. 	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems54
3387. 	Upon so soft a subject as myself!35
3388. 	What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?48
3389. 	Some comfort, nurse.22
3390. 1
3391. Nurse	Faith, here it is.25
3392. 	Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,50
3393. 	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;49
3394. 	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.44
3395. 	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,48
3396. 	I think it best you married with the county.46
3397. 	O, he's a lovely gentleman!29
3398. 	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,46
3399. 	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye45
3400. 	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,39
3401. 	I think you are happy in this second match,45
3402. 	For it excels your first: or if it did not,45
3403. 	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,48
3404. 	As living here and you no use of him.39
3405. 1
3406. JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?37
3407. 1
3408. Nurse	And from my soul too;28
3409. 	Or else beshrew them both.28
3410. 1
3411. JULIET	Amen!13
3412. 1
3413. Nurse	What?12
3414. 1
3415. JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.53
3416. 	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,36
3417. 	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,49
3418. 	To make confession and to be absolved.40
3419. 1
3420. Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.46
3421. 1
3422. 	[Exit]8
3423. 1
3424. JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!47
3425. 	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,42
3426. 	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue47
3427. 	Which she hath praised him with above compare47
3428. 	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;41
3429. 	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.46
3430. 	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:40
3431. 	If all else fail, myself have power to die.45

3449. 1
3450. FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.57
3451. 1
3452. PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;41
3453. 	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.43
3454. 1
3455. FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:56
3456. 	Uneven is the course, I like it not.38
3457. 1
3458. PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,49
3459. 	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;45
3460. 	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.43
3461. 	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous42
3462. 	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,45
3463. 	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,40
3464. 	To stop the inundation of her tears;38
3465. 	Which, too much minded by herself alone,42
3466. 	May be put from her by society:33
3467. 	Now do you know the reason of this haste.43

3480. JULIET	What must be shall be.30
3481. 1
3482. FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.38
3483. 1
3484. PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?50
3485. 1
3486. JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.48
3487. 1
3488. PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.43
3489. 1
3490. JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.46
3491. 1
3492. PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.47
3493. 1
3494. JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,45
3495. 	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.50
3496. 1
3497. PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.53
3498. 1
3499. JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;49
3500. 	For it was bad enough before their spite.43
3501. 1
3502. PARIS	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.59
3503. 1
3504. JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;50
3505. 	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.42
3506. 1
3507. PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.52
3508. 1
3509. JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.45
3510. 	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;39
3511. 	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?41
3512. 1
3513. FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.60
3514. 	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.42
3515. 1
3516. PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!44
3517. 	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:44
3518. 	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.44
3519. 1
3520. 	[Exit]8
3521. 1
3522. JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,52
3523. 	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!53
3524. 1
3525. FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;53
3526. 	It strains me past the compass of my wits:44
3527. 	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,48
3528. 	On Thursday next be married to this county.45
3529. 1
3530. JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,54
3531. 	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:43
3532. 	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,45
3533. 	Do thou but call my resolution wise,38
3534. 	And with this knife I'll help it presently.45
3535. 	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;50
3536. 	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,45
3537. 	Shall be the label to another deed,37
3538. 	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt42
3539. 	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:45
3540. 	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,46
3541. 	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,43
3542. 	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife45
3543. 	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that41
3544. 	Which the commission of thy years and art43
3545. 	Could to no issue of true honour bring.41
3546. 	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,41
3547. 	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.44
3548. 1
3549. FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,56
3550. 	Which craves as desperate an execution.41
3551. 	As that is desperate which we would prevent.46
3552. 	If, rather than to marry County Paris,40
3553. 	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,49
3554. 	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake39
3555. 	A thing like death to chide away this shame,46
3556. 	That copest with death himself to scape from it:50
3557. 	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.45
3558. 1
3559. JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,48
3560. 	From off the battlements of yonder tower;43
3561. 	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk42
3562. 	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;50
3563. 	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,40
3564. 	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,52
3565. 	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;47
3566. 	Or bid me go into a new-made grave36
3567. 	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;44
3568. 	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;55
3569. 	And I will do it without fear or doubt,41
3570. 	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.45
3571. 1
3572. FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent59
3573. 	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:41
3574. 	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;43
3575. 	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:49
3576. 	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,41
3577. 	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;43
3578. 	When presently through all thy veins shall run48
3579. 	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse40
3580. 	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:47
3581. 	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;50
3582. 	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade45
3583. 	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,40
3584. 	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;47
3585. 	Each part, deprived of supple government,43
3586. 	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:53
3587. 	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death47
3588. 	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,42
3589. 	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.42
3590. 	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes47
3591. 	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:50
3592. 	Then, as the manner of our country is,40
3593. 	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier41
3594. 	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault48
3595. 	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.44
3596. 	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,45
3597. 	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,43
3598. 	And hither shall he come: and he and I40
3599. 	Will watch thy waking, and that very night44
3600. 	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.40
3601. 	And this shall free thee from this present shame;51
3602. 	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,42
3603. 	Abate thy valour in the acting it.36
3604. 1
3605. JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!49
3606. 1
3607. FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous60
3608. 	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed47
3609. 	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.41
3610. 1
3611. JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.62

3762. 	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,49
3763. 	Because he married me before to Romeo?40
3764. 	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,49

3766. 	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,39

3768. 	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!45

3770. 	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,52
3771. 	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?45
3772. 	Or, if I live, is it not very like,37
3773. 	The horrible conceit of death and night,42
3774. 	Together with the terror of the place,--42
3775. 	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,39
3776. 	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones48

3779. 	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,51
3780. 	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--46
3781. 	Alack, alack, is it not like that I,38
3782. 	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,46
3783. 	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,52
3784. 	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--47
3785. 	O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,42
3786. 	Environed with all these hideous fears?41
3787. 	And madly play with my forefather's joints?45

3790. 	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?47

3934. 	Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;49

3951. 	O son! the night before thy wedding-day41
3952. 	Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,48
3953. 	Flower as she was, deflowered by him.39
3954. 	Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;43

3986. 1
3987. FRIAR LAURENCE	Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not64
3988. 	In these confusions. Heaven and yourself42
3989. 	Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,50
3990. 	And all the better is it for the maid:40
3991. 	Your part in her you could not keep from death,49

3993. 	The most you sought was her promotion;40
3994. 	For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:47
3995. 	And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced41
3996. 	Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?45
3997. 	O, in this love, you love your child so ill,46
3998. 	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:44
3999. 	She's not well married that lives married long;49
4000. 	But she's best married that dies married young.49
4001. 	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary44
4002. 	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,44
4003. 	In all her best array bear her to church:43
4004. 	For though fond nature bids us an lament,43

4114. 1
4115. ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,52
4116. 	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:45
4117. 	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;45
4118. 	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit41
4119. 	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.51
4120. 	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--43
4121. 	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave44
4122. 	to think!--13
4123. 	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,48
4124. 	That I revived, and was an emperor.37
4125. 	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,44
4126. 	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!45

4131. 	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?48
4132. 	How doth my lady? Is my father well?38
4133. 	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;40
4134. 	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.41
4135. 1
4136. BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:52
4137. 	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,38
4138. 	And her immortal part with angels lives.42
4139. 	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,44
4140. 	And presently took post to tell it you:41
4141. 	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,43
4142. 	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.44
4143. 1
4144. ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!45
4145. 	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,48
4146. 	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.46
4147. 1
4148. BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:48
4149. 	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import45
4150. 	Some misadventure.20
4151. 1
4152. ROMEO	                  Tush, thou art deceived:49
4153. 	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.43
4154. 	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?44

4156. BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.28

4162. 1
4163. 	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.46
4164. 	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift49
4165. 	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!44
4166. 	I do remember an apothecary,--32
4167. 	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted47
4168. 	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,45
4169. 	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,44
4170. 	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:41
4171. 	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,40
4172. 	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins39
4173. 	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves45
4174. 	A beggarly account of empty boxes,36
4175. 	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,47
4176. 	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,48
4177. 	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.43
4178. 	Noting this penury, to myself I said38
4179. 	'An if a man did need a poison now,37
4180. 	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,40
4181. 	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'49
4182. 	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;47
4183. 	And this same needy man must sell it me.42
4184. 	As I remember, this should be the house.42
4185. 	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.43
4186. 	What, ho! apothecary!23

4191. 1
4192. ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:50
4193. 	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have42
4194. 	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear43
4195. 	As will disperse itself through all the veins47
4196. 	That the life-weary taker may fall dead41
4197. 	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath48
4198. 	As violently as hasty powder fired36
4199. 	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.42
4200. 1
4201. Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law54
4202. 	Is death to any he that utters them.38
4203. 1
4204. ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,49
4205. 	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,46
4206. 	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,45
4207. 	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;43
4208. 	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;50
4209. 	The world affords no law to make thee rich;45
4210. 	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.48
4211. 1
4212. Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.50
4213. 1
4214. ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.43
4215. 1
4216. Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,50
4217. 	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength48
4218. 	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.48
4219. 1
4220. ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,54
4221. 	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,45
4222. 	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.53
4223. 	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.45
4224. 	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.47
4225. 	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me42
4226. 	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.47

4675. 	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;48

4677. 	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day47
4678. 	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death46
4679. 	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,49
4680. 	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.45
4681. 	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,46
4682. 	Betroth'd and would have married her perforce47
4683. 	To County Paris: then comes she to me,40
4684. 	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean47
4685. 	To rid her from this second marriage,39
4686. 	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.45
4687. 	Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,40
4688. 	A sleeping potion; which so took effect41
4689. 	As I intended, for it wrought on her38
4690. 	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,46
4691. 	That he should hither come as this dire night,48
4692. 	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,46
4693. 	Being the time the potion's force should cease.49
4694. 	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,42
4695. 	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight41
4696. 	Return'd my letter back. Then all alone41
4697. 	At the prefixed hour of her waking,37
4698. 	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;46
4699. 	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,41
4700. 	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:42
4701. 	But when I came, some minute ere the time43
4702. 	Of her awaking, here untimely lay35
4703. 	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.38
4704. 	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,44
4705. 	And bear this work of heaven with patience:45
4706. 	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;46
4707. 	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,47
4708. 	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.44
4709. 	All this I know; and to the marriage38
4710. 	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this43
4711. 	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life41
